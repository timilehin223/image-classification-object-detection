# image-classification-object-detection
This repository contains implementations for image classification and object detection using OpenCV's Deep Neural Network (DNN) module. The project demonstrates how to utilize pre-trained deep learning models, such as Inception (GoogleNet) for image classification and MobileNetSSD for real-time object detection.
# Features
(a) Image classification using Inception (GoogleNet) trained on ImageNet
(b) Object detection using MobileNetSSD
(c) Support for Raspberry Pi and PC with a camera
(d) Real-time video processing for object detection
